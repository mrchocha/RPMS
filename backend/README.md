# Role of Node.js
Data coming from frontend i.e. React js needs to fetched and implementing queries in backend database systems and sending results from backend to frontend and hence act as a bridge 
between frontend and backend and also called as runtime environment.

# How to start the server side?
Run in your terminal
```
node server.js
```
And if output is 
```
Listening on PORT 5000
```
then your runtime environment is set up and is working fine.
